## 💎 Why This Kit?

Unlike standard kits, the **Ultimate Kit** uses a **Triple-Hybrid Recursive Architecture**. It doesn't just give you tools; it gives you a self-correcting, high-intelligence environment for software engineering.

### 🧠 The Constitution (Modular Rules)
Our rules are no longer a single file. They are a modular governance system:
- **`General.md`**: The Socratic Gate & Agent Protocol.
- **`Coding.md`**: Strict static analysis, Magic Number bans, and Clean Code standards.
- **`UX.md`**: Modern design principles, Glassmorphism, and the "Purple Ban".
- **`Security.md`**: Hardened secrets management and OWASP alignment.
- **`Performance.md`**: Core Web Vitals and bundle optimization.

## 🚀 Workflows (The Nervous System)

Invoke specialized AI procedures with simple slash commands:

| Command | Capability |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/brainstorm` | Strategic discovery via Socratic questioning. |
| `/plan` | Recursive task breakdown and roadmap generation. |
| `/create` | **Super-Command**: Build new features from scratch with elite standards. |
| `/enhance` | Refactor and level up existing codebases. |
| `/debug` | 4-phase systematic root cause analysis and fixing. |
| `/ui-ux-pro-max` | Generate premium, state-of-the-art UI with 50+ styles. |
| `/orchestrate` | Multi-agent coordination (Backend, Frontend, Security). |

## 🧩 Skills (The Knowledge Engine)

Over **38+ specialized skills** integrated from top industry standards (Vercel, Google, Airbnb):
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js Expert, Tailwind v4, Mobile-First Design.
- **Backend**: API Patterns (REST/GraphQL/tRPC), Node.js Best Practices.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, CI/CD, Server Management.
- **Intelligence**: Prompt Enhancer, Feature Adviser, Geo-Fundamentals.
